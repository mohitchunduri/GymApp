# GymApp

This repository contains a very small ASP.NET Core web application with a React-based UI. It lets you add simple workout entries and view them in a list.

## Running the app

1. Ensure the .NET 8 SDK is installed.
2. From the `GymAppWeb` directory run:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

The page lets you add exercises and reps, storing them in-memory for the duration of the session.
